    star when he was first cast as Thor, God of Thunder, but he turned out to be one of the
    best things about this never-ending mega-franchise. He’s tall, brawny and impossibly
    handsome, but there’s a self-mocking twinkle in his eye. When Thor is in gung-ho jock
    mode, Hemsworth’s wry machismo evokes the young Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an
    eyebrow at the corniness around him. When he bumbles and stumbles, there’s a touch of
     Cary Grant to his embarrassment. And when he’s playing things more or less straight,
     there’s an average guyness to his reactions. All this humanizes an actor who’s
     perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.
